# Introduction

This is a stash of code for my development practices to match with opensource and available platforms. I want to put this away as a means of writing a c# project with **CI semantics** built in to it.

# Files

Just started with a simple Class library in C#, nothing special in the code here.. it is just lorem ipsum stuff..


## To do list

These are the features I expect of a CI semantic:

|                 | Status                            | Proof                        |
