[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rasane/csharpCI.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rasane/csharpCI)

# Introduction

This is just a **personal** stash of code for my development practices in house to match with opensource and available platforms. I want to put this away as a means of writing a c# project with **CI semantics** built in to it.

# Files

Just started with a simple Class library in C#, nothing special in the code here.. it is just lorem ipsum stuff..


## To do list

These are the features I expect of a CI semantic:

|                 | Status                            | Proof                        |
